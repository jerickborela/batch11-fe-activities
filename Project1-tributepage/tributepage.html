                <h2>One Piece </h2>
                <p>One Piece is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda. It has been serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since July 1997, with its individual chapters compiled into 99 tankōbon volumes as of June 2021. The story follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body gained the properties of rubber after unintentionally eating a Devil Fruit. With his crew of pirates, named the Straw Hat Pirates, Luffy explores the Grand Line in search of the world's ultimate treasure known as "One Piece" in order to become the next King of the Pirates.</p>

                <h2> One-shots </h2>
                <h4> Wanted! </h4>
                <p>Wanted! is a one-shot manga by Eiichiro Oda, produced during his senior year of high school in 1992. It was submitted - under the pseudonym Tsuki Himizu Kikondo - to the 44th Tezuka Awards and won Second Class, earning Oda ¥500,000 and marking his debut in the manga industry.</p>

                <h4> Romance Dawn </h4>
                <p>Romance Dawn refers to two stories written by Eiichiro Oda before One Piece but set in a similar world. While a first-year junior high school student, he began sketching out ideas for a pirate-themed manga in a notebook, in pencil. Years later, as an assistant to Rurouni Kenshin author Nobuhiro Watsuki, he began refining his ideas into what would become "Romance Dawn", and later, One Piece. All 3 versions were published in Weekly Shonen Jump magazine, with the final incarnation published exactly one year after the first.</p>

                <h4> Monsters </h4>
                <p>Monsters is a oneshot manga by Eiichiro Oda, originally published in the 1994 Shonen Jump Autumn Special. It was later reprinted in 1998 as part of Wanted!, a compilation of Oda's pre-One Piece stories.</p>
